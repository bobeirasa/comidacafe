It is perfectly clear for me: Sushiguen is the best restaurant in São Paulo, and one of the best sushi restaurant in the world. Located in São Paulo's downtown, near Av. Paulista, this is a tiny restaurant placed inside a gallery that cross the streets Brigadeiro Luis Antonio and Manuel da Nóbrega; I've been five times in March, and the more I go the best it is; specially the last one, where I was in companion of my friends 鮫島 サンチアゴ and Samuel Masini and asked Shimizu that I would be taking pictures for the blog.

The owner and Chef Shimizu came from Japan in a ship, decades ago, and now is there is his own restaurant making sushi for more than 40 years, along with his fellow sushimans Helio and <> and, all japanese too.

Sushiguen is on the TOP score of our evaluation, reaching the best-in-class grade for restaurants in São Paulo, a *must go* if you visit the city. When you go there, sit at the balcony to have the best handcrafted sushi masterpieces directly from Shimizu's hands to your plate; he mades the pieces according to your size and don't go there expecting rolls with creamchese and hot philadelfias and _texmex_ japanese food. Sushiguen is a traditional restaurant for fish lovers.

Sushiguen's address is [Av. Brigadeiro Luís Antônio, 76 - Jardim Paulista, São Paulo - SP, 01403-010](https://www.google.com.br/maps/place/Sushiguen/@-23.5684038,-46.6492447,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x11bb57606fe66164?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjrt_Of-u_LAhWHE5AKHX0eDu4Q_BIIejAK), it is evaluated with 4.6 stars in Google and 4.5 stars in [Trip Advisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g303631-d2468282-Reviews-Sushiguen-Sao_Paulo_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html) and listed on #467 of 34,581 catalogued restaurants in São Paulo, with the following reviews:

> Traditional style Japanese restaurant. Don't expect California rolls or coffee at the end. Fish is extremely fresh and masterly prepared. You also have exotic food, like special fish eggs (Gunkan Maki). Excellent Tirashi, Sashimi and Tempura. Nice and friendly staff.

> Sushiguen is a simple, but traditional japanese restaurant near Avenida Paulista. The cuisine is neat, authentic and fresh. Ask for sashimi, and accept suggestions from the experienced sushiman. Sit at the counter. The service is quick and the price is fair.

> Fresh sushi small place very good service seat on the bar and enjoy the sushi master . Dont expect more than great fish , hard to find

> This is one of my favorite restaurantes in SP. It is not a fancy place, it looks like ecxactly the same as it looks 30 years ago, but food is awesome. Fish are very fresh and shushi man know what he does! I love it when in SP I go there whenever I can!

> Sushiguen is a classic, traditional Japanese restaurant that lies in a bit of a hidden spot of SP. The sushiman, Shimisu-san, has owned this place since its beginning. If you're ready for a great meal, ask him to make a special selection of whatever's fresh.

> Take a seat on the sushi bar and watch Shimizu preparing beatiful and delicious Niguiris, Tirashis and Sashimis. He is one of the oldest and most traditional sushimen in Sao Paulo.
