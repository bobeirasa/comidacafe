Yes, in English from now on. I will start living in New York in April and for this reason I will be more in the USA than in Brazil. I intend to visiting new restaurants around there and for this reason the posting will be in English from now on.

I was abroad this week, and Rodrigo (my friend) has recommended this sushi restaurant; there are 2 Nagaokas in Mexico City, one located in Calle Arkansas 38 and the other one in Av. Insurgentes Sur 1761. I have been in the first, the Caje Arkansas one. When I arrived, I saw some Japanese guys eating, and it is always a pleasant surprise when you enter a japanese restaurant and see japanese people eating. Another observation is that if you see Kikkoman being used as Shoyu sausage, you went into the right spot.

[Nagaoka] is a simple japanese restaurant that has an excellent japanese food for a very affordable price in Mexico City. Very well localized, it is walking distance (10 minutes) from WTC and this timing is good for making the food digestion after eating.

Bullseye!! I went to the right place.Check out some [Trip Advisor] reviews:

> Bravo!!! - This restaurant is one of the few places I would go every day to. Simply because of its great -authentic food always served fresh. It is always crowded and people are willing to wait because they know what they came for. I've been to one of the most expensive Japanese restaurants here in Mexico City and though it was pretty nice Nagaoka stays out of any competition.

On the first time I went there, I ordered Futomaki (太巻) and Baby Squirrel, but I forgot to take pictures of it. On the second and third time, I ordered the same thing: a Kushiage (串揚げ), which came mixed with fish, vegetables and shrimp for the staters, and a Chirashi (ちらし寿司) for main dishes. The recommendation is take the sausage for further use, but I don't like to put sausages on the Chirashi because it mess with the flavour. I'd rather then eat just the fish and Gohan (ご飯, rice), with a little bit, just a little bit of Shoyu sauce.

To drink I had a warm green tea, served in a nice japanese jar.

I staid for 5 days in Mexico and I went there 3 times, so good it is. The entire menu is available [here](http://www.nagaoka.com.mx/pdf/menu-2013.pdf) (big PDF file), you can have an idea on how food is just looking to the pictures. I hope I get back to Mexico soon to go there again! Check the [official website][Nagaoka] and [Trip Advisor] page. It is very well rated.
