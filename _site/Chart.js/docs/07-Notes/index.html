<h3>Browser support</h3>

<p>Browser support for the canvas element is available in all modern &amp; major mobile browsers <a href="http://caniuse.com/canvas" target="_blank">(caniuse.com/canvas)</a>.</p>

<p>For IE8 &amp; below, I would recommend using the polyfill ExplorerCanvas - available at <a href="https://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/" target="_blank">https://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/</a>. It falls back to Internet explorer&#39;s format VML when canvas support is not available. Example use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
    <span class="c">&lt;!--[if lte IE 8]&gt;</span>
<span class="c">        &lt;script src=&quot;excanvas.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class="c">    &lt;![endif]--&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Usually I would recommend feature detection to choose whether or not to load a polyfill, rather than IE conditional comments, however in this case, VML is a Microsoft proprietary format, so it will only work in IE.</p>

<p>Some important points to note in my experience using ExplorerCanvas as a fallback.</p>

<ul>
<li>Initialise charts on load rather than DOMContentReady when using the library, as sometimes a race condition will occur, and it will result in an error when trying to get the 2d context of a canvas.</li>
<li>New VML DOM elements are being created for each animation frame and there is no hardware acceleration. As a result animation is usually slow and jerky, with flashing text. It is a good idea to dynamically turn off animation based on canvas support. I recommend using the excellent <a href="http://modernizr.com/" target="_blank">Modernizr</a> to do this.</li>
<li>When declaring fonts, the library explorercanvas requires the font name to be in single quotes inside the string. For example, instead of your scaleFontFamily property being simply &quot;Arial&quot;, explorercanvas support, use &quot;&#39;Arial&#39;&quot; instead. Chart.js does this for default values.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugs &amp; issues</h3>

<p>Please report these on the GitHub page - at <a href="https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js" target="_blank">github.com/nnnick/Chart.js</a>. If you could include a link to a simple <a href="http://jsbin.com/" target="_blank">jsbin</a> or similar to demonstrate the issue, that&#39;d be really helpful.</p>

<h3>Contributing</h3>

<p>New contributions to the library are welcome, just a couple of guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tabs for indentation, not spaces please.</li>
<li>Please ensure you&#39;re changing the individual files in <code>/src</code>, not the concatenated output in the <code>Chart.js</code> file in the root of the repo.</li>
<li>Please check that your code will pass <code>jshint</code> code standards, <code>gulp jshint</code> will run this for you.</li>
<li>Please keep pull requests concise, and document new functionality in the relevant <code>.md</code> file.</li>
<li>Consider whether your changes are useful for all users, or if creating a Chart.js extension would be more appropriate.</li>
</ul>
